## SUMMARY:

I am a junior front-end developer. I began my journey by passing various online courses such as HTML Academy and Codecademy, where I got basic knowledge.

At the beginning of 2019, took the course of Web application development with JavaScript by IT-Academy Educational Center of HTP. Now I continue to study independently and develop the acquired skills.
